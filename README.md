## Assignment Guide

I have created a dedicated plugin to handle all the above tasks. The plugin code exists in the **registration-form** folder inside the plugins directory in WordPress.

A demo installation of this functionality can be found here: [https://pivotroots.gayatri.life](https://pivotroots.gayatri.life).

The following `username:passwords` exist.

* `leo:labradog` (Admin / Country: India)
* `pradip:deorukhkar` (Country: USA)
* `preshit:deorukhkar` (Country: Canada)
* `gayatri:tanksali` (Country: India)
* `Rohan:naravane` (Country: USA)

There are two separate pages to exhibit this functionality. 

**Upload Gallery**

On this page, registered users can upload images to the site. If a user isn't logged in, the page prompts the user to log in first. If the user isn't registered, the user can register an account using a nifty link provided.

**Gallery**

On this page, registered in users can view all images uploaded by users from the same country they're from. If a user isn't logged in, the page prompts the user to log in first. If the user isn't registered, the user can register an account using a nifty link provided.
